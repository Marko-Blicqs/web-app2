ERROR AND ISSUES
================================================================================================
1) Using FreeSimpleGUI
   This would not run. Two solutions were proposed here (https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/93).

   I solved this by setting the following environment variables in my activate script:
    $env:TCL_LIBRARY = "C:\Python32\tcl\tcl8.5"
    $env:TK_LIBRARY = "C:\Python32\tcl\tk8.5"

   And, I took a similar approach by modifying my activate.bat script to include:

    set TCL_LIBRARY=C:\Python26\ArcGIS10.0\tcl\tcl8.5
    set TK_LIBRARY=C:\Python26\ArcGIS10.0\tcl\tk8.5

    My activate.bat file:
        C:\Users\marko.kennedy\PycharmProjects\TodoListApp\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    I appended the following:

    @set "TCL_LIBRARY=C:\Users\marko.kennedy\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\tcl\tcl8.6"
    @set "TK_LIBRARY=C:\Users\marko.kennedy\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\tcl\tk8.6"
